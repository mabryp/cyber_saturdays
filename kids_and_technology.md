# Kids and Social Media
    1. What is Social Media?
        Social media facilitates the sharing of ideas and information through virtual networks.

        Likes, Shares, re-tweets, comments, and other interactions with media are all considered social media.

        Anything where a user can interact with other users is considered social media.  This includes:
            - Facebook
            - Twitter
            - Instagram
            - Snapchat
            - Pinterest
            - Reddit
            - Tumblr
            - LinkedIn
            - YouTube
            - WhatsApp
            - TikTok
            - Telegram
            - WeChat

        And there are many more, with even more added everyday.   

    2. Who should use Social Media?
        Perhaps no one?  Social Media is the new pornography.  It is addictive, descriptive, and can be dangerous. It is not appropriate for children. 

        It lowers inhibitions.  Social Media in 2021 spent nearly 50 Billion dollars on research and development.

        According to the Worldwide Statitistics on Internet usage above, 94% of the over 5 billion people online access the internet for Social Media. 

        Adults over 35 who use apps like TikTok and SnapChat were found to be more likely to have mental health issues.  This is because they are more likely to be addicted to Social Media.  They are more likely to be depressed, anxious, and lonely.

    c. What are the risks of Social Media?
       Feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, dispair, and isolation.  

       Social media does NOT make people feel more connected, it makes people more lonely. 

       "Growing research finds that the more time spent on social media, the more likely a person will experience mental health symptoms like anxiety, isolation, and hopelessness. And according to one recent study, high levels of social media use over the span of four years was associated with increased depression among middle and high school youths."

        What, 'exactly', is the problem with Social Media?
           # It's the "Like", "Share," and "Comments" that makes Social Media so addictive.  It's the dopamine hit that makes you want to keep coming back for more.  Social media does to Human Relationships what Pornagraphy has done to Sex.  
              - It rewards the bad stuff
              - It's fake
              - It's destructive
              - It's not appropriate for children 

        Social Media is causing depression among teen girls:

    d. How can you protect your children from the risks of Social Media?
       :
       Go as long as possible without any Social Media.  

       Once they are on Social Media, limit their time and monitor their activity ( we will talk about HOW to do this in a bit ). 
       Digital Detox!  
           Daily and Weekly Digital Detox!

       All of the research provided shows that children need time with eachother without devices.  The more time they engage with one another in real life, the better they are at handling the difficulties of online activities.  


Monitoring Your own Devices 
1. Biggest Threats
    A. Open WiFi
        - Attackers will set up open WiFi Access Points inticing people to connect.  When a person connects they will be able to see all of the traffic on that network.  This includes passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. 
    B. Sketchy Games
        - Attackers will set up games and apps on Play stores and App stores that look like they are from a legitimate company.  When you download and install the app, it will install a virus on your device.  The virus will then send all of your information to the attacker.  Even if you uninstall the app the damage may be done.  Removing the app may not remove the threat. 
    C. Phishing / Link / Attachment
       - Attackers will send you emails that look like they are from a legitimate company.  They will ask you to click on a link or open an attachment.  When you do this, the link or attachment will install a virus on your device.  The virus will then send all of your information to the attacker.  
2. Anti-virus / Anti-malware
    A. What is a virus?
        - A virus is a program that can replicate itself and spread from one computer to another.  It can also be used to corrupt data on a computer.  Viruses are usually spread by email attachments, infected files, or infected websites.
    B. What is Malware?
        - Malware is a program that is designed to damage or disable a computer.  It can also be used to steal information from a computer.  Malware is usually spread by email attachments, infected files, or infected websites.
    C. What is a Trojan Horse?
        - A Trojan Horse is a program that is designed to look like a legitimate program.  It can be used to steal information from a computer.  Trojan Horses are usually spread by email attachments, infected files, or infected websites.
